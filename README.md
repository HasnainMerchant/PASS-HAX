# Pass Hax [IBM - Hackathon]

## About

  The most common form of authentication is the combination of a username
  and a password or passphrase. If both match values stored within a locally
  stored table, the user is authenticated for a connection. Password strength is
  a measure of the difficulty involved in guessing or breaking the password
  through cryptographic techniques or library-based automated testing of
  alternate values.

  A weak password might be very short or only use alphanumberic characters,
  making decryption simple. A weak password can also be one that is easily
  guessed by someone profiling the user, such as a birthday, nickname, name of a pet, or a common word such as God, love, money or password.

  That is why PASS HAX was made, and it can be used in situations like legal
  penetration tests or forensic crime investigations.
